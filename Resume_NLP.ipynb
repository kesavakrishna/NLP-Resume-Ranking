January 2014 August 2014 Follet An application which takes an electronic request from the user for the books he requires from a particular follet store This detailed information about books that will include the name of the book its price the date of the transaction and the parties involved which will then be sent to follet stores User then create request for one or more books for a given date This request is then processed further and user gets a mail of the date when he will be provided with that book Responsibilities Understanding the needs and business requirements Preparing BRD SRS by eliciting all the requirements from the client and SMEs Understanding the dependency of the modules in the system Preparation of test plan for Unit level and Integration level Preparation and
